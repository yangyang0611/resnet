# ResNet docs

Blog posts and notebooks exploring residual networks.

## To run

Requires python 3.6+. Runs fine on CPU. From this directory setup environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This should launch jupyter notebooks in your browser, from where you can open and run any of the `.ipynb` notebook files.
