# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition: CIFAR-10, PyTorch Implementation

An implementation of the "ResNet" paper *Deep Residual Learning for Image Recogniton* [1]. This PyTorch implementation produces results within 1% of the authors' reported test error. 

The main procudure is describe as jupyter notebook in `main.ipynb` viewable [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/a-martyn/resnet/blob/master/main.ipynb).

## Architecture
Below are the architure of different layers.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 experiment from section 4.2 of the paper is reproduced. The goal is to classify tiny 32x32 pixel images into one of 10 classes. Some examples below. This implementation achieves 92.67% test set accuracy in this setting.

## Requirements
You will need the following to run the above:

- TensorFlow
- Pytorch
- Colab
If your computer didnâ€™t have GPU, it will consume plenty of time for training
